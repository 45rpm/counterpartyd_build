counterpartyd Build System (counterpartyd_build)
==================================================

`counterpartyd_build <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd_build>`__ is the automated build system for
`counterpartyd <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd>`__. This is an alternative method from
`manual counterpartyd installation and running <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd/blob/master/README.md>`__,
as a source code build script that takes care of all setup necessary to run ``counterpartyd`` from source.

Some tips::

* If you are a **Windows** or **Ubuntu Linux user**, you can :doc:`use the build system to automate your install/setup from source <BuildingFromSource>`.
* If you are **neither**, at this point you will need to follow `the manual installation instructions <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd/blob/master/README.md>`__.
* If you'd like to set up your own self-contained, full fledged Counterparty server, check out the :doc:`Setting up a Federated Node <SettingUpAFederatedNode>` document.

More information on Counterparty is available from our `homepage <https://counterparty.co>`__.
